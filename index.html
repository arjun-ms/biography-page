  <p>
    Hey!
    I am a curious guy who loves to tinker with tech and build products. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    From my first year of college, I have been actively leading a tech community called TinkerHub with my teammates for over 3 years. At TinkerHub, We organized workshops and hackathons, helping students learn new technologies and work together on projects.
  </p>
  <p>
  In my second year, I worked as a Discord Bot Developer at GTech Mulearn for over a year. I contributed to a bot called Aaronchettan to automate community tasks and improve how members interacted with each other.
  </p>
  <p>
  I also led the AI Interest Group for Gtech ùùÅLearn with my teammates, where I connected students with industry mentors, organized learning sessions, and guided them in building AI-based projects.
  </p>
  <p>
  Around the start of my 3rd year, I worked as an AI Researcher Intern at DocketGo, where I built a RAG-based querying system for lawyers. This system allows lawyers to enter a legal situation and get the relevant IPC sections that apply to or go against the case, improving the speed and accuracy of legal research.
  </p>
  <p>
  Additionally, I served as the ACTO (Assistant Chief Technical Officer) at IEDC-JEC (Innovation and Entrepreneurship Development Center - Jyothi Engineering College). In this role, I mentored students on their tech projects and helped them network with industry experts.
  </p>
